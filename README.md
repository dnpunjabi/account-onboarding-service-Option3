# Account Onboarding Service - Strategy Comparison

This document compares three strategies for implementing the account onboarding service, considering factors like maintainability, flexibility, and scalability.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Option 1: Feature-Based Strategy | Option 2: Service Factory by Customer & Product Type | Option 3: Specific Customer-Product Services |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Each feature is a separate strategy. Runtime checks determine customer type and product. | Services handle multiple product types for specific customer types. Features are called within these services. | Dedicated service classes for each unique customer-product combination (e.g., `NaturalPersonCurrentAccountService`). |
| **Pros** | * **Modular Features:** Promotes code reusability and independent feature development.<br>* **Easy Feature Addition:** Simplifies adding new features without modifying existing ones.<br>* **Runtime Flexibility:** Adapts to various customer-product combinations dynamically. | * **Clear Separation:** Organizes logic by customer type, improving clarity.<br>* **Reduced Logic:** Less conditional logic compared to the feature-based approach.<br>* **Maintainability:** Centralized customer type logic simplifies maintenance.<br>* **Extensible:** Easily add services for new customer types. | * **Explicit Implementation:** Crystal-clear, purpose-built services for each combination.<br>* **No Runtime Logic:** Eliminates runtime conditional checks, improving performance.<br>* **Maximum Flexibility:** Highly adaptable to complex, specific business rules.<br>* **Maintainability:** Focused services are easier to understand and maintain.<br>* **Granular Control:**  Fine-grained separation of concerns. |
| **Cons** | * **Complex Logic:**  Feature complexity increases with more customer-product combinations.<br>* **Code Duplication:** Potential for duplicated logic across features.<br>* **Maintainability Challenge:** Harder to maintain as conditions grow.<br>* **Lack of Clarity:** Less explicit handling of specific combinations. | * **Broader Services:** Services might become less focused as they handle multiple product types.<br>* **Reduced Granularity:** Less control over specific product-customer interactions. | * **Numerous Classes:**  Can lead to a large number of service classes.<br>* **Initial Setup:** Requires more upfront setup and boilerplate code.<br>* **Potential Duplication:**  Possible code duplication across similar services (mitigate with shared base classes or utilities). |
